            <h2>Mission</h2>

            <p>
              A mission statement is a short summary of an organizations core
              purpose, focus, and aims. This usually includes a brief
              description of what the organization does and its key objectives.

            <h2>Vission</h2>
            <p>
              A vision statement is a short description of an organizations
              aspirations and the wider impact it aims to create. It should be a
              guiding beacon to everyone within the organization and something
              which underpins internal decision-making and determines the
              intended direction of the organization.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
              It is possible to reach the top of success only by working hard.
              Every human being has the responsibility to fulfill his / her
              dream of one or the other life and it is possible only if he / she
              can stick to his / her own devotion.
